    <!-- About -->
    <section class="section" id="about">
      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
        I’m a data and AI professional who blends real-world analytical rigor with a genuine curiosity 
        for what’s possible in machine learning and artificial intelligence. In my day-to-day work, 
        I turn large, complex datasets into clear strategic insights through forecasting, automation, 
        and interactive dashboards. Outside of work, I explore the creative side of AI experimenting 
        with generative models, computer vision, and systems that understand people more deeply.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
        <strong>In my professional roles</strong>, I’ve built scalable data workflows that reduce manual 
        reporting by 30%, calibrated forecasting models, and developed visual tools that help stakeholders 
        make faster, data-driven decisions. I specialize in transforming messy real-world data into trustworthy 
        assets that inform both business strategy and public policy.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
        <strong>On my own time</strong>, I dive into AI through self-directed projects: I’ve trained 
        T5 transformer models for empathetic dialogue generation, evaluated object detection systems 
        under varying lighting conditions, and built NLP pipelines that extract emotion and context 
        from conversations. These projects reflect my belief that AI should be not only accurate but also 
        intuitive, responsible, and human-aligned.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom: 1.5em;">
        I’m actively seeking roles as a <strong>Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, AI Engineer, 
        or Data Analyst</strong> where I can bring both disciplined data craftsmanship and innovative AI 
        thinking to solve meaningful problems.
